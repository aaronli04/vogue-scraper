Amanemu,,"For further relaxation head over to the spa, where Thai practices are combined with Japanese customs. Otherwise, laze by the outdoor infinity pool or unwind in the adjacent lounge while tunes are played on a vintage JBL Paragon speaker. During your stay, you’ll have two on-site restaurants to choose from—including the reservation-only Atelier, where French cuisine meets local ingredients—along with an intimate bar with a wraparound balcony overlooking Beppu.",,
"The Ritz-Carlton, Nikko",,"Over in Mie Prefecture, Amanemu is a luxurious ryokan-inspired property with a serene ambiance that sets the tone for a relaxing getaway. Plus, it offers several onsen options. To start, all of the well-appointed and incredibly spacious accommodations feature deep soaking tubs with hot spring water on tap. If you opt for one of the four villas, each one comes with its own separate onsen-style space complete with bathing stations to evoke traditional facilities. (Tip: Tsuki Villa is particularly special, with an onsen area that has both indoor and outdoor tubs.) In addition to the en-suite basins, the spa also has two bookable pavilions that can easily be paired with a treatment of your choice. And if that’s not enough, the pool is also fed with hot spring water. Swimsuits are required since it’s not private, but the beautiful setting—complete with daybeds, a fire pit, lush greenery, and fresh air—is irresistible. While you’re here make sure to also ask the staff to arrange a lunch with an ama. These female free divers scour the ocean for edible jewels like seaweed, lobster, and mollusks and grill their fresh catch in an amagoya hut. The Shima Peninsula is home to Japan’s largest population of ama and it’s the perfect opportunity to learn about this unique, ancient culture.",,

,,"Set on a bluff overlooking Ago Bay, the walls of this intimate hotel are lined with paintings by Yayoi Kusama. After you’ve perused the gallery-esque hallways, you’ll be whisked away to one of the hotel’s eight rooms, which are even split between two buildings. While all of the accommodations sport hot spring–fed bathtubs, the larger rooms in the annex are outfitted with beautiful stone basins that look out to a furnished balcony. And if the view from your in-room oasis isn’t enough, there’s also an open-air onsen at the spa that can be booked for private sessions. While you’re here, make sure to dine at the on-site French restaurant to savor some of the region’s delicacies like Matsusaka beef and an array of seafood such as spiny lobster and abalone.",,
Le Bristol,,"It feels reductive to say a Paris hotel has old-world charm, given nearly every building has a history that dates back a century (or far more). Yet the family-owned Le Bristol, with its fluffy Louis XVI fauteuils, Pierre Fray Fabrics, and resident white Burmese cat Socrate, exudes a Parisian elegance that’s almost all-encompassing. The pièce de résistance? Their garden, where you can enjoy a croque monsieur surrounded by roses and orange trees. —Elise Taylor, senior living writer","Restaurants, bars, pool, café, fitness center, spa, children’s club, bicycle rentals","Address: 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré, Paris, Paris, 75008"
The Peninsula Paris,,"A stone’s throw away from the Arc de Triomphe in the 16th arrondissement is The Peninsula Paris, housed in the former palace of the exiled Queen Isabella II of Spain. (It later became Hotel Majestic, where George Gershwin wrote An American in Paris, before becoming the Ministry of Defense.) Somehow, the Peninsula has managed to honor its illustrious past while operating a thoroughly modern hotel: one minute, you can gaze out your Beaux-Arts balcony dreaming of Brassai’s Paris At Night, another, you can operate your in-room iPad to submit an array of requests that will be executed within minutes. (I’ve never had a pair of pants pressed faster in my life.)

Cheval Blanc Paris,,"​​“The feel is 1930s meets 1970s, cool elegance with a bit of grooviness,” Vogue wrote of the new Blanc Paris, which opened in September 2021. The LVMH-owned hotel boasts four restaurants—including an outpost of the famous Milan seafood brasserie Langosteria and the three-Michelin starred Le Plénitude—a Dior spa, as well as a Rossano Ferretti Salon. Yet, perhaps the most wonderful thing about the Coeval Blanc is the simplest: the views of the Pont Neuf and The Seine, which guests can take in from their Peter Marino-designed guest rooms. —E.T.","Restaurants, bars, pool, spa, fitness center","Address: 8 Quai du Louvre, 75001 Paris, France"
Le Meurice,,"The rich and illustrious history of Le Meurice is genuinely mindboggling: with its central location and sweeping views over the Tuileries Gardens, the hotel, which dates back over two centuries, has played host to glamorous figures from Elizabeth Taylor to Mata Hari. But arguably its biggest claim to fame? Its seriously impressive credentials as a meeting place for some of the 20th century’s most prestigious artists and thinkers. (Salvador Dalí spent an entire month here annually for three decades, while everyone from Émile Zola to Andy Warhol to Bob Dylan has spent time roaming its corridors, and Picasso even hosted his wedding reception there.)","Restaurant, bar, pool, fitness center, spa, hair salon","Address: 30 Avenue Georges V, 75008 Paris, France"
Shangri-La Paris,,"It’s a spirit that still courses through the energy of the hotel today, with its playful, iconoclastic interiors, from the surreal sculpture of two swirling columns locked in an embrace that dominates the lobby, to the breathtaking painting that covers the entire ceiling of the central dining space that was created by Phillipe Starck’s daughter, Ara, when he gave the hotel a comprehensive design refresh in 2007. Take a short elevator ride up to one of the hotel’s 160 rooms and suites, however, and you’ll find the classic interior stylings of a grand Paris hotel (it is housed within what’s believed to be the oldest palace in France, after all) delivered with an effortlessly light touch, with a palette of creams and powder blues covering plush bedrooms and delicately marbled bathrooms. Oh, and don’t forget to check out the culinary options here too—not least the flagship two-Michelin-starred restaurant by Alain Ducasse, which takes a whimsical approach to fine dining that is entirely in keeping with the hotel as a whole. —L.H.","Full-service spa, two restaurants, health club, laundry facilities, ballroom and event spaces","Address: 228 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France"
Hotel Madame Rêve,,"When it comes to the 100-room and suite Shangri-La Paris, the word “grand” is an understatement. When pulling up to this tony hotel, you’ll find that its entrance is somehow both magnificent and discreet, set back from Avenue d’Iéna and further obscured by a graceful landscaping design of palms and flora. Walk in, and a stately lounge unfolds to the right, check-in on your left, all while porters busily whisk Rimowa suitcases and designer garment bags to and fro. It’s very luxe. Very old school. And very international. Worth noting: This property is housed in the former home of Prince Roland Bonaparte, in the 16th arrondissement, and it’s one of the few five-star hotels in Paris that has close-up views of the Eiffel Tower. It’s also home to the Michelin-starred Shang Palace, a haute Chinese restaurant. But my recommendation?

La Fantaisie,,"The first thing I noticed about La Fantaisie, a new hotel in Paris’s 9th arrondissement, is a phrase etched into the pavement out front: “Enchanté,” or “nice to meet you.” But its literal translation is apt as well, as an enchanting forest of delights grows within. The lobby ceiling is covered in a tapestry resembling a tree canopy, tables in the salon are supported by petal-shaped legs, while the dense foliage-themed wallpaper in its corridors looks like it could have been lifted from the pages of Where The Wild Things Are. (The interior designer behind it all is Martin Brudnizki, the modern maximalist master also known for projects like Annabel’s in London and Hotel Fouquet’s in New York.) The hotel also has a restaurant by the three-Michelin-starred chef, Dominique Crenn, and a rooftop bar that overlooks the Haussman facades of Paris. —E.T.","Restaurants, bars, café, gym, rooftop terrace and bar, bicycle rentals, spa","Address: 48 Rue du Louvre, 75001 Paris, France"

Don’t miss the world-class spa buried deep within the basement of the building, either. Newly refurbished and overseen by team Dior, its soothing treatment rooms feature butter-soft Dior blankets and cushions—as well as the best hydrafacial you’ll find across the entire city—it will send you back onto its streets (for more shopping, probably) with a newfound glow. —L.H.","Restaurant, rooftop bar, café, spa, garden","Address: 24 Rue Cadet, 75009 Paris, France"
Ritz Paris,,"There are iconic hotels, and then there is the Ritz Paris: first established in its historic location on the Place Vendôme in 1898 by the legendary Swiss hotelier César Ritz, its popularity and mythos have never waned over the decades since. (Even when, in 2012, the hotel was closed for four years for renovations, with the final days of its former iteration being memorably captured in a Kate Moss-starring fashion shoot for Vogue.) Of course, history lovers will find plenty to satisfy their curiosity here, whether revisiting its presence in classic books by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, or tracing the footsteps of its illustrious guests from over the decades, whether Coco Chanel or Audrey Hepburn. But the hotel still shines for its exquisitely decorated rooms, impeccable service, and the high gastronomy of its various restaurants—the Ritz remains a Parisian classic for good reason. —L.H.","Restaurants, bars, pool, fitness center, spa, salon, private members club, boutiques","Address: 25 Avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris, France"

Once hunger strikes, head down to the glass-roofed Casa Tua for Italian fare then mosey on over to the bar for a stellar negroni.

Château Voltaire,https://www.chateauvoltaire.com/en/,"Formerly Zadig & Voltaire’s headquarters, Thierry Gillier, the fashion label’s founder, entrusted artistic director Franck Durand and design duo Festern to convert a trio of 17th- and 18th-century buildings into the impossibly chic 32-key Château Voltaire. On the ground floor, you’ll find an inviting Arts & Crafts–style sitting room; La Coquille d’Or, a sexy Art Deco bar swathed in black, gold, and shell motifs (hence the name); and Brasserie L’Emil, the all-day restaurant serving Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Just below, a small spa includes a wellness space, complete with a sauna and wading pool, that can be privatized for an hour. All of the rooms differ slightly due to the varying nature of the three buildings, but common threads include fringed velvet furnishings, manor-style woodwork, black and white checkered-tile bathroom floors, and an aura of Parisian art de vivre. And if the stylish digs at this intimate hideaway aren’t enough to draw you in, consider its spectacular location in the 1st, just blocks away from the Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens, Little Tokyo, the Palais Garnier, and Place Vendôme. —C.L.","Restaurant, bar, fitness center, art collection, pool, terrace","Address: 45 Rue la Bruyère, 75009 Paris, France"
Hôtel Lutetia,,"For all of Hôtel Lutetia’s Art Nouveau glory (the property first opened in 1910), there’s a notable modernity about the place. For one, its rooms are, in this writer’s opinion, the most seamlessly integrated with technology of any luxury hotel worldwide. Simple touchscreens control everything from lighting to sheer curtains–there’s zero learning curve, and the screens work flawlessly. It’s the little things that count! In fact, all of Lutetia’s interior feels up to date–a contemporary hub within a picturesque, golden-era facade. In public areas, there’s a scene-y bar, a brasserie restaurant, and all-day dining in its atrium. Hotel guests can make use of a private library, with its sleek cool tones (it’s a perfect meeting space, as well as a swimming pool–a rarity in Paris. Most impressively, though: Lutetia is the city’s only luxury palace-style hotel in the perma-hip neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Près. It is also Paris’ sole five-star hotel on the Left Bank.

SO/ Paris,https://so-hotels.com/en/paris/,"However, panoramic vistas alone do not make for a great hotel, but thankfully SO/ Paris has more going for it than just breathtaking views. A futuristic lobby filled with walls of orange-hued mirrors, tulip-shaped columns, contemporary artwork, and staff wearing Guillaume Henry–designed uniforms sets the tone for a stylish stay. Upstairs, the 162 accommodations are bright, colorful, and stocked with sumptuous Maison Codage products, a French skincare brand that’s also behind the subterranean spa. (There’s also a touch of whimsy courtesy of the Bluetooth speaker in the shape of a bulldog.) Just make sure to book a room with a view of the Seine, where you can watch the bateaux mouches make their way along the river.

Sinner Paris,http://sinnerparis.com/en/,"With a name like Sinner, it comes as no surprise that this hotel is one of the most mischievous and provocative hotels in Paris. Evok Collection’s third property borrows its inspiration from medieval churches—vaulted ceilings, black cassock-like uniforms, holy water fonts—but with a much naughtier twist that gives a hint of 2018 Met Gala Madonna. And if there’s one neighborhood in Paris where this concept works, it’s the hip and edgy Marais. Dimly lit corridors are decorated with stained glass mosaics depicting bare bodies. Red, dungeon-esque doors reveal, in contrast, bright and airy rooms, but, in keeping with the theme, risqué touches like suggestive artwork, tubes of lubricant on the bathroom counters, and leather riding crops in the closet. It's a unique experience that’s not meant for the demure. But with all that being said, accommodations still boast luxurious details like oversize wet rooms, plush bedding, curated minibars, turntables with a collection of vinyls, high-tech washlets, and Dyson hair tools on request. By day, unwind at the candlelit spa with a treatment curated by Swiss brand La Colline.

It’s the second Paris property for Experimental Group, which started as a bar in 2007 and is often credited with bringing cocktail culture to the French capital before having expanded to restaurants and hotels. Naturally, its two bars are the crown jewels. The Shell, inspired by Marie Antoinette’s affinity for seashells and a nod to the building’s pre-Revolution history, is an intimate and sultry space decked out in burgundy. But when the weather warms up locals flock to The Shed on the roof for creative concoctions that include non-alcoholic and half-strength tipples. After you’ve had a couple of drinks, retire to one of the 50 cozy rooms.

Step through the sleek glass and steel entryway designed by starchitect Richard Rogers, and head down one of its rabbit-warren corridors to find the elegantly-proportioned Blue Bar or the cozy snug area of the Berkeley Bar with its playful, hand-painted murals, or simply make a beeline for the bright, airy café to enjoy one of the city’s most popular (and deservedly so) afternoon teas. If you’re looking for a serious treat, however, book yourself in for one of the spectacular counter service tasting menus of wildly intricate pastries and cakes courtesy of the award-winning pâtissier Cédric Grolet. As far as the hotel’s 190 individually-designed accommodations go, with its minimalist, quietly luxurious design scheme, there isn’t a bad room in the house. Arguably the greatest star attraction, however? That would be the breathtaking rooftop pool, with its expansive views across Hyde Park and the Thames.

But when the buzzy, sustainability-minded chain 1 Hotels landed in a prime spot on Berkeley Street earlier this summer, just steps away from Fortnum & Mason and the Royal Academy, the property’s point of difference quickly became clear. From the trellised facade bursting with greenery, to the airy interiors of its 181 rooms—all featuring natural oak surfaces, Welsh slate bathroom surfaces, potted plants, organic Bamford products, and even your own drinking water tap embedded in a moss-covered wall—the vibe is more laid-back Californian oasis than the fusty traditionalism of many of its neighbors.

Luxuriously-appointed rooms feature crisp Frette sheets and sleek, minimal interiors that further foster the feeling you’re in your very own tranquil haven, while the hotel’s Indigo restaurant—with its convivial atmosphere and seasonal menu of inventive British classics—is esteemed enough to attract locals alongside One Aldwych guests.

Not a hotel to rest on its laurels, however, the ever-evolving offering at the Ciragan Palace ensures that repeat guests—and there are plenty of them—always have something new to discover. A recent refurbishment has added a fresh, contemporary touch to the Ottoman-inspired interiors of its 310 rooms and 31 suites, with elegant striped wallpaper in shades of burgundy and deep blue and lavishly marbled bathrooms.

And in keeping with Istanbul’s broader spirit of paying reverence to the past while never being afraid to reinvent those traditions, the group’s signature cozy aesthetic has been applied to the historic surroundings of the former U.S. embassy in which Soho House sits with thoughtfulness and care.

(Think traditional iznik tiles in the bathrooms, all stocked with copious amounts of Cowshed and Soho Skin products, or kilim cushions scattered across the plush linens of your enormous king-size bed.) The hotel is a culinary destination in its own right, too, with local Istanbulites packing out its four restaurants, including an outpost of the popular Italian restaurant group Cecconi’s and superb, summer-only Greek-Mykonian eatery Apheleia, with offers a gyros-taco hybrid topped with tomato confit and paprika yogurt, and beef souvlaki and giant prawns cooked in an outdoor Josper oven.

It’s an outlook best enjoyed from the hotel’s stunning rooftop restaurant and bar—or, indeed, its Michelin-recommended dining destination Octo. Overseen by the Portuguese chef Jorge Lavos Costa, the restaurant uses local Turkish produce to whizz up riffs on classic dishes from both his homeland and across Latin America, from sea bass tartar tacos to grilled octopus and grouper.

It’s a place set up to feel like you can stay awhile—and many do. Like the Fasano, many of their lodging offerings have an apartment-like layout complete with kitchens, meaning guests can book for months or more. — E.T.","Restaurants, bars, fitness center, pet friendly, library, business center, terrace, in-room massages","Address: 28 East 63rd Street, New York, NY, 10065"
"Soho House, Meatpacking District",,"Housed in the historic Crown building on 57th Street, designed by the same architects as Grand Central Terminal, Aman's signature Japanese-meets-Scandinavian minimalism is present in full force: neutrals, woods, and shades of black adorn the spacious 83 guest rooms, the vast spa, and the rooftop terrace. Modern art is scattered throughout: each suite, for example, has a mural by contemporary Japanese artist Ryoko Adachi. Yet despite all the worldly influences, the property also has a local touch: a jazz club, open to the public, offering nightly performances. — E.T.","Restaurants, bar, jazz club, swimming pool, fitness center, spa, sauna, steam room, complimentary house cars","Address: 730 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019"
"The Baccarat, Midtown",,"The unfussy approach begins with the room selection (pick between cozy, medium, and big) and extends to the charming, homely decor, from velvety sofas to weathered leather ottomans to roll-top copper bathtubs to match the brass light fittings and doorknobs. The perfectly-judged menu also has something to satisfy every craving, whether that’s a hearty bowl of cacio e pepe after a red-eye, or a lighter chopped salad or poké bowl for a room service night in. Two decades since it first opened, there’s still nowhere that makes you feel like you’re staying the night at a friend’s (in the best way possible) quite like Soho House. — Liam Hess","Outdoor swimming pool, restaurant, bar, spa, complimentary Wi-Fi","Address: 29-35 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10014"

"The Ned, NoMad",,"Private members’ club The Ned, which opened to much fanfare this spring, includes a well-appointed hotel where no application is required. The guest rooms follow a rich jewel-tone aesthetic, inspired by the Beaux-Arts architecture of the building and the 1920s style of their sister property in London. “I wanted to make it glamorous—to have loads of atmosphere,” CEO and founder of Soho House Nick Jones previously told Vogue. — E.T.","Restaurants, bars, terrace, fitness center, complimentary Wi-Fi","Address: 1170 Broadway , NoMad, New York, NY 10001"
"Hotel Chelsea, Chelsea",,"Plenty of hotels are willing to refer to themselves as iconic, but few have earned the moniker quite like the Hotel Chelsea. Behind its red brick, iron-balconied facade—and its immediately recognizable neon signage—Madonna shot her most provocative photographs, Lou Reed strummed his guitar, Andy Warhol rolled his camera, and Dylan Thomas took his final breath. Following a period where its status as a residence looked in serious danger, and then a lengthy refurbishment by the team behind The Bowery and The Jane, the Hotel Chelsea finally reopened its doors this spring with a glamorous new makeover—albeit one that has been carefully considered to ensure it retains plenty of its original charms.","Restaurants, bars, complimentary Continental Breakfast, fitness center, personal trainers","Address: 147 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012"

Baron’s Cove (Sag Harbor),,"While many Hamptons hotels lean into a beachy clapboard aesthetic, Baron’s Cove—located in the historic whaling town of Sag Harbor–embraces the nautical: navy blue is the interior color of choice, while anchors and ropes serve as accents.

The Faena (Mid-Beach),,"The Faena, with its bold red awnings, gold-leaf ceilings, and unabashed embrace of animal print, exudes a dramatic, disorderly glamor. Which, for many in Miami, is exactly what you want—this is the city, after all, known for its magnetic atmosphere of neon lights, pool parties, and nightclubs. The Faena allows you to indulge in this maximalist energy without sacrificing comfort: its guest rooms have Carrara marble bathrooms and private butlers, while its restaurant, Los Fuegos, is helmed by Michelin-starred chef Francis Mallman. Then, there’s its famous art glass-encased mammoth titled “Gone But Not Forgotten,” by Damien Hirst. (Go ahead, take a picture—you know you want to.)",,
Soho Beach House (Mid-Beach),,"Meanwhile, the rooms—featuring tiled floors, exposed wood beams, and palm-decorated curtains—exude an English country home meets Miami bungalow ambiance, whereas the Cowshed spa is the perfect play to amp up for (or wind down from) the famed Miami social scene.

East (Brickell),,,,
,https://www.drexelmiami.com/,"Best of all is their restaurant The Drexel, which is the second Miami restaurant from the famed team behind the beloved Design District haunt Mandolin. Here, the emphasis is on clean flavors, with a charcoal grill and wood oven producing wild prawns, smoked guanciale pizza, and roasted eggplant. Don’t miss their 10-dollar wine happy hour.",,
Castello di Vicarello,,"There’s a magical quality to driving through the winding roads of the Tuscan countryside. The evocative landscape of rolling hills and sweeping vineyards studded with cypress trees and its cluster of medieval towns and bucolic farmhouses always feels like a celluloid moment. Yet while a visit to Tuscany is always a good idea, in my opinion, the fall is the very best time to visit—when the endless green vistas begin to ripple with varying shades of orange, red, and yellow foliage and the scent of the harvest perfumes the crisp autumnal air.",,
,,"At Castello di Vicarello, you can be a part of the grape harvest beginning in September, where you’ll begin in the heart of the vineyards and learn how to properly harvest the grapes grown on the estate, as well as enjoy a personal masterclass in wine production before indulging in a seasonal Tuscan lunch. You’ll get to experience the olive harvest in October and November by picking olives in the olive grove and visiting the mill, then sample the freshly pressed olive oil during a traditional three-course lunch.",,
Borgo Santo Pietro,,,,
Hotel Castello di Reschio,,,,
,,"For an even deeper culinary experience, guests can accompany the chef for a spot of truffle hunting before returning to the hotel for lunch, where they’ll sample their new-found truffle as well as the estate’s very own olive oil, wine, and honey.",,
Monteverdi Tuscany,,,,
"Castello di Casole, A Belmond Hotel",,,,
Castello Banfi Wine Resort,,"At Castello di Casole, A Belmond Hotel, the luxury property contains 39 rooms, a traditional Tuscan restaurant, a pool and spa, an ancient amphitheater, a vineyard, olive groves and even a game reserve. The hotel offers various activities to reap the benefits of Tuscany’s majestic fall season—from sunset safari tours to guided hikes through the ruins of the old abbey. The 25 acres of organic vineyard produce Cabernet, Sangiovese, Merlot, and Petit Verdot varieties, while the 30 acres of olive groves, which are harvested each fall, produce only 2,500 bottles of the estate’s private-label extra virgin olive oil annually for exclusive use at Castello di Casole.",,
,,"As this is a wine resort, a glass of Brunello is never far away and always best experienced after harvest in the fall. Guests can book a tour of the winery followed by a four-course lunch paired with wines at the Taverna or indulge in the various tastings offered at the enoteca.",,
,,"All of which is to say, there’s never been a better time to visit the region. Here, Vogue rounds up seven of the best hotels in Puglia to visit this summer—and return to, again and again.",,
Borgo Egnazia,https://www.borgoegnazia.com,"Walking through the cobbled streets that comprise Borgo Egnazia as the evening light casts a golden glow over the clocktower, you wouldn’t guess for a moment that this sprawling, breathtakingly beautiful property was only built in 2010. That’s right: Every one of Borgo Egnazia’s meticulously designed rooms, suites, and villas—183 in total—might appear centuries-old on the surface, but they reach a world standard in luxury mod cons. (Rumor has it that architect Pino Brescia, a native Puglian who was hired for his knowledge of the quirks of the region’s traditional building techniques, even went around chipping at the walls with a chisel to ensure the creamy local sandstone looked as authentically weathered as possible.) When you find yourself getting pleasantly lost in Borgo Egnazia’s alleyways, it’s clear that was part of the plan.",,
,,"While Borgo Egnazia is very much the brainchild of couple Aldo Melpignano and Camilla Vender—the latter also runs an exquisitely curated boutique, Bottega Egnazia, as part of the hotel complex—the story actually runs a generation further back; specifically, to Melpignano’s parents. After establishing Masseria San Domenico, the first luxury hotel in the region in 1996, Sergio and Marisa Melpignano played a crucial role in establishing Puglia as the growing tourist hotspot it is today by making a conscious effort to market the region abroad. With Melpignano and Vender’s willingness to both take up the mantle and push that vision to the next level, the wildly ambitious Borgo Egnazia project came to be.",,
,,"There are almost too many experiences available at Borgo Egnazia to list: two beach clubs, a golf course, an atmospheric spa inspired by Roman baths, vintage car tours, cooking classes, oil and wine tastings, and trekking. But despite the enormous scale of the complex and the near-overwhelming number of things to do, there’s an innate sense of calm that radiates from the property’s white stone walls, as well as a sense of total privacy within each of the bedrooms or casette suites, named quite literally after “little houses.” (This feeling of seclusion is undoubtedly a reason why it’s become a particular celebrity favorite, most famously hosting Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel’s 2012 wedding. Recent guests have included Victoria and David Beckham.) Borgo Egnazia’s tagline is “nowhere else”—after a few days in paradise there, you’ll find it impossible to disagree.",,
Castello di Ugento,https://castellodiugento.com/,"In the region of Salento, 15 minutes or so inland from the white sandy beaches that line the peninsula’s southern tip, lies the tranquil town of Ugento. And at its heart sits Castello di Ugento, the impressive castle at the town’s highest point. Most of what is visible today was constructed in the 17th century, but it also features the foundations of an 11th-century Norman tower, rediscovered while the building was being lovingly refurbished half a decade ago, and that can now be seen through glass floors in the dining area.",,
,https://www.masserialemandorle.com,"It’s the kind of attention to detail—and instinct for preservation—that characterizes the property’s restoration at the hands of Massimo d’Amore and his partner, Diana Bianchi. (The d’Amore family’s ownership of the castle dates all the way back to its 17th-century splendor.) Nine individually decorated rooms are complemented by an orchard garden as well as a sister property a few minutes down the road, Masseria Le Mandorle, that features a swimming pool and slick sports facilities.",,
,,"A major highlight here is the food: The hotel restaurant, Il Tempo Nuovo, sees chef Tommaso Sanguedolce put an impressively fresh and unfussy twist on traditional Puglian cuisine, while the now well-established Puglia Culinary Centre offers cooking courses and classes for everyone from beginners to Michelin-star chefs wanting to learn more about Italian cuisine. Finally, there’s an impressive series of rooms on the building’s piano nobile featuring Baroque frescoes that have been recently restored, within which Bianchi is gearing up to stage a series of exhibitions featuring contemporary artists both local and from further afield. When it comes to offering opportunities for Puglian cultural immersion, Castello di Ugento is hard to beat.",,
Masseria Torre Maizza,https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/masseria-torre-maizza/,"Masseria Torre Maizza, found in the cluster of luxurious masserias that have sprung up between the towns of Fasano and Savelletri, was established as one of the first high-end stays in the region back in the 2000s. Since being taken over and refurbished by Rocco Forte Hotels in 2019, however, the property has found a new lease on life. In many ways, it’s the quintessential vision of a relaxed masseria holiday with all of the rustic details of a typical farm stay: a sparkling blue pool, fresh fruit, bicycles to ride through the olive groves. But it’s the details found in its interiors and dining that elevates it, largely thanks to the aesthetic vision realized by Olga Polizzi, Rocco Forte’s sister and the chain’s design director. The hotel’s gorgeous restaurant, for example, sits within a pergola draped with ivy and roses overlooking the property’s orchard.",,
,,"There’s a sense, when at Masseria Torre Maizza, that time has stopped. The large pool area features a bar offering crisp local wines and creative riffs on Italian aperitivi. The spa is stocked with products by Forte’s daughter, Irene, with scrubs and oils directly inspired by the Mediterranean botanicals of southern Italy. (Despite being a hotel group, Rocco Forte’s relatively modest size ensures much of its most welcoming details are those which have been kept within the family.) It’s a small slice of heaven that feels almost specifically designed for you to laze away a summer’s afternoon under an orange tree, book in hand, as a cool sea breeze rustles through the trees.",,
Palazzo Daniele,https://palazzodaniele.com,"Another option in the Salento region is Palazzo Daniele, found in the small but inviting town of Gagliano del Capo that is merely five minutes drive from some of the region’s most spectacular beaches. Yet the real delights of Palazzo Daniele lie within its own 19th-century walls, which, despite being smack in the center of town, include peaceful gardens and a beautifully outfitted swimming pool. The hotel’s playful but tastefully realized decor is partly the result of its previous life hosting artist residencies. Its owner, former lawyer and art collector Francesco Petrucci, decided to collaborate with his friend Gabriele Salini—who also owns the modish G-Rough hotel in Rome—to convert the property into a 10-room boutique stay that opened in the spring of 2019.",,
,,"The result is a charming mish-mash of ceiling frescoes with cutting-edge contemporary art, sympathetically reconciled by the Milanese architects and designers Ludovica and Roberto Palomba. The monastic plaster walls have been left largely untouched, their weathered surfaces and cracks kept intact, with any interventions largely offered by artist-designed light fittings and the occasional piece of carefully placed modernist furniture. Each room contains its own unexpected details. The bathroom might be accessed by a narrow staircase that once included a secret passageway that extended all the way to the nearby beaches, while even a more conventional en suite features a rain shower in the middle of the room with a shell-like basin, so you can live out your best Birth of Venus fantasy.",,
,,"Again, the culinary offering is a major highlight here. An open kitchen means you can help yourself to pastries or request eggs your way in the morning with the help of local cooks whose families have lived in the town for generations; at lunch, they’ll prepare a meal of however many courses you can handle in the shaded area by the pool, all sourced from local farmers. At night, the outdoor area transforms once again, with string lights sparkling in the trees and an on-site bartender ready to whip up one of their signature inventive cocktails. The hotel’s motto is “questa casa non è un albergo,” or “this house is not a hotel,” a fact that is reflected in the generously proportioned shared living areas and the open bar built around a former religious shrine. Petrucci, who previously kept an apartment within the complex that was recently converted into the hotel’s newest accommodation, the Black Suite—demonstrates it’s more than just a tagline. After a few hours within Palazzo Daniele, you’ll feel like the place is yours too.",,
Masseria Calderisi,https://www.masseriacalderisi.com,"A relative newcomer to the scene—and all the more energetic for it—Masseria Calderisi was established last year by its charismatic German owners, Max and Jutta von Braunmühl, who fell in love with Puglia in the 2000s and married in the region a decade ago. (The pair, and their children, can often be found mingling with guests, whether escorting them to the sea in a four-wheel drive or stopping by their dinner tables for a digestivo.) There’s an exuberant feeling about this property, evident in the range of activities on offer—an afternoon at their private strip of beach, a boat trip along the Adriatic, or a body scrub at the spa with honey, salt, and lemon from the masseria’s gardens—as well as in its lovely boutique which stocks local ceramics, jams, and olive oils alongside casual pieces and beachwear from the likes of Etro, Max Mara, and Missoni.",,
,,"This sense of warmth and liveliness extends to the impeccable hospitality, which manages to be friendly and keenly attentive without ever feeling overbearing. So too is it visible in the organic conviviality between guests, many of whom are clearly satisfied to chat about finding this undiscovered gem within the region’s ever-growing number of luxury masserias. If you’re looking to strike up conversation with those on the sun lounger next to you, there’s no awkwardness here; you might even bump into them again while participating in a morning bread-baking session in the hotel’s restored wood-fire oven, or at the pizza party in the large courtyard that takes place twice a week. Masseria Calderisi is a slice of classic Puglian paradise with a fresh, youthful-feeling twist.",,
Paragon 700 Boutique Hotel & Spa,,,,
,,"The expansive bar area is Baroque by way of Tim Burton: statues of macabre grinning monkeys sit next to defaced reinterpretations of Renaissance paintings, while candelabras dripping with red wax line the tables where artist-designed sofas are upholstered with sewn-together silk ties. The hotel’s 11 individually designed rooms are intentionally more relaxed, with frescoed ceilings, warm lighting fixtures, and stonewashed linen sheets. Despite the flamboyant trappings of its decor, however, both wellness and sustainability are a priority here. The spa, reached by glass elevator and built into the underground caves that are atmospherically lit with candles, feature a hydromassage basin, a Turkish bath, a Himalayan salt wall, and even a natural whirlpool dug deeper into the ground. Meanwhile, the hotel’s commitments to micro-CHP energy, zero plastics, and local construction materials are also notable.",,
,,"Probably the biggest facet of Paragon 700’s appeal, though, is its prime location within Ostuni, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region, but that somehow manages never to feel wildly overcrowded. Getting lost in the city’s labyrinth of alleyways and admiring its Gothic cathedral are unmissable elements of a Puglian vacation all on their own—but knowing you can return to the homely environs of Paragon 700 for a refreshing dip in the pool, a cocktail as delightfully offbeat as the decor, and finally a meal in their gourmet, open-kitchen Restaurant 700 to round off the evening makes the experience all the sweeter.",,
Castle Elvira,https://www.castleelvira.com/,"A new opening for 2022, Castle Elvira sits atop a picturesque ridgeway 20 minutes or so outside of the historic city of Lecce, surrounded by 37 acres of wild gardens, olive and citrus groves, and lush parkland. But the real star of the show is the castle itself: according to legend, it was built in the early 20th century by a Neapolitan family for their teenage daughter Elvira, who died soon after, leaving the castle abandoned for over 100 years. In 2018, a British couple purchased the property and set about reviving it to its former glories—albeit with a very 21st-century twist.",,
Baglioni Masseria Muzza,,,,
,https://www.baglionihotels.com/branches/baglioni-masseria-muzza/,"Arguably the year’s splashiest new opening in Puglia comes courtesy of Baglioni Hotels & Resorts, the Italian-owned and run luxury hotel group placing a particular emphasis on the country’s cultural hotspots—and their latest property, located a few miles out of Otranto and overlooking the idyllic Lake Alimini, doesn’t disappoint. Masseria Muzza is a sprawling complex of 17th-century whitewashed farmhouses that have been sensitively updated to feature all of the uber-deluxe mod cons you’d expect from a hotel of its caliber.",,
,,"Those who need to be by a body of water at all times to truly relax will find succor here. The jewel in Masseria Muzza’s crown is its enormous infinity pool—featuring in-built hydromassage loungers and island platforms—for cooling off in the Puglian summer heat, while a shuttle service will whisk you away to a nearby beach in central Otranto with a dedicated area and sunloungers if you fancy a dip in the sea. (The hotel is also mere minutes away from the sparkling blue waters of one of the region’s most breathtaking beaches, the Baia dei Turchi.) Elsewhere, a cavernous spa complex features every amenity you could dream of, from an ice fountain to a Finnish sauna to a steam bath.",,
La Fiermontina,,"Equally top-notch are the hotel’s culinary offerings, from a relaxed poolside restaurant perfect for enjoying a lazy lunch of salads and light pasta dishes to the restaurant in the evening—decorated with the region’s famously flamboyant luminarie, or twinkling colored lights, and surrounded by lemon trees—which offers local cooking alongside wood-fired pizzas. (There are also gourmet tasting menus on offer at the resort’s third restaurant, Le Site, if that’s your bag.) If it’s pure, unadulterated indulgence you’re seeking, Masseria Muzza is the one to beat.",,
,,"If you’re looking for the perfect city base to explore the south of Puglia, look no further than Lecce, the Salento town whose historic center is packed with dozens of churches and palazzi decorated with intricate Baroque carvings cut from the local limestone. (Throughout the day, as the natural light shifts, they seem to almost magically change color.) And if you’re then looking for somewhere to stay in the heart of the city, the names to know are La Fiermontina and its sister property Palazzo Bozzi Corso.",,
,,"The former sits on the outskirts of the centro storico, thus featuring an unusual amount of space for a city stay in the typically narrow, winding streets of the region, as well as 18 individually designed rooms that blend the traditional trappings of Pugliese decor, from crisp white linens and cream stone walls, with elegant mid-century furniture in muted tones arranged just so. And that’s without mentioning the lush gardens and perfectly sized pool surrounded by olive trees, ready for when you need to cool off after a day of wandering Lecce’s bustling markets and museums.",,
Palazzo Ducale Venturi,,"Palazzo Bozzi Corso, meanwhile, is situated slap-bang in the middle of the city, just steps away from the breathtakingly ornate facade of the Basilica di Santa Croce. Step into the courtyard of this historic palazzo from the busy street outside, however, and an atmospheric hush takes over (and that’s before even heading down to its subterranean wellness space). The interiors speak to the design nous of its owners, the Fiermonte family—the high-ceilinged rooms on the piano nobile best show off their masterful eye for color and proportion—and its the rich history of the family and their guardianship of the property that resonates most strongly, lending these two perfectly Leccese properties their beating heart.",,
,,"As with the best of Puglia’s gloriously grand townhouses, the Palazzo Ducale Venturi offers little suggestion from the outside of the treasure trove in store when you step through the pedestrian entryway cut into its grand wooden doors. Situated in the sleepy, charming town of Minervino di Lecce on the southwestern corner of the peninsula, 15 minutes or so west of the lively beach town of Otranto, the palazzo’s gardens—humming with wildlife, and featuring everything from a medieval well to a herb garden to columns overflowing with white bougainvillea—and an impossibly tranquil pool constitute its own small world.",,
Palazzo Presta,,"If you do wish to venture further, however, Palazzo Ducale Venturi sits in a perfect location to explore the southern tip of the boot, in particular the array of rocky coves and secluded beaches that dot the nearby shoreline. But thanks to its particularly impressive food offering—chef ​​Antonio Russo offers elevated takes on Salentine cooking with a particular emphasis on mouth-wateringly fresh seafood—and a small but cutting-edge spa area that features an underground pool converted from an ancient oil mill, you don’t even really need to leave the four walls of its domain anyway.",,
,,"Palazzo Presta is located in Gallipoli, a somewhat off-the-beaten-track town on the west coast of Salento that, before you ask, bears no relation to the Turkish peninsula of the same name. And as far as the city’s selection of hotels go, Palazzo Presta stands head and shoulders above the rest. Not only is it right in the beating heart of Gallipoli’s historic island old town (and merely a few hundred yards from its convenient, centrally located beach, the Spiaggia della Purità) but Palazzo Presta’s achingly stylish interiors would be worth the trip alone.",,
,,"Its owners, Eugenia and Antonio, have reinvented its rabbit warren interiors to balance in-the-know nods to design history with a sense of worldly eclecticism, the walls decorated in bold colors and adorned with everything from maritime flags to vintage Japanese prints to racy contemporary photography. The real star of the show, however, is its rambling, two-story rooftop terrace, which features views over the city that can be enjoyed from plush striped seating—and, of course, an inventive cocktail courtesy of the terrace’s dedicated rooftop bar, open every evening just in time for a sundowner.",,

In a converted printing factory, just a 15-minute walk from the hotel, the 47-year-old department store’s second location contains a strong edit: Off-White, Prada, Sies Marjan, Rick Owens, and Johanna Ortiz, as well as avant and emerging designers only found at that location to meet the offbeat sensibilities of East London clientele. A café, exhibition gallery, and immersive experience room (where you might catch a meditation session) will also be part of your trip. East 21 Club Row, London, E2 7EY; brownsfashion.com.",,

To see what’s percolating in Scandinavian design, walk just 50 yards down the street to The Frozen Fountain, a playful contemporary furniture and interiors boutique that brings together Dutch designers of the moment with exciting local talent.

A foyer lined with floor-to-ceiling windows, white orchids, and lights beaming from the floor make for a grand entrance. Your senses are further stimulated by the soothing pastel hues and softened golden tones that dress the elegant pied-à-terre throughout. Make your way to the bathroom, and you’ve entered into your own personal oasis, where a one-ton marble infinity tub, with a chromotherapy system, rivals an oversize walk-in shower. Natural light floods in and more white orchids are encased in glass displays—it’s airy, it’s bright, and it’s downright magnificent. Furthermore, the bedroom has its own balcony outfitted with a sunbed, a posh living room furnished with a bookcase filled with antique books, and a marble mosaic–floor parlor fit for an intimate gathering. But the pièce de résistance is the terrace that opens out from the conservatory, where views of the Eiffel Tower are meant to be savored and that is undoubtedly the best spot for FOMO–inducing Instagrams (don’t forget to include a lovely breakfast spread). Walk up the adjacent spiral staircase and you’ll find yourself at a small landing where you feel like you’re far removed from everyone and everything else. It’s easy to spend hours up there, taking in breathtaking views of the city, preferably with a glass of Champagne in hand. But don’t get too hooked on room service; just a few floors below, you’ll find three outstanding eateries so good that they are all Michelin-approved, making the Four Seasons Hotel George V the first hotel in the country with a trio of starred restaurants.",,

But make your way to the first floor and you’ll find the sprawling one-bedroom Peninsula Suite.

The front of the hotel is adorned with a traditional Chinese entry gate. Guests pull up — usually in a Mercedes or Rolls Royce — to the entry, and are whisked away by uniformed doormen into the lobby. The soaring three-story space is lined with over 3,500 pieces of Palissandro marble, the stone’s ivory finish and cool grey veins creating a sense of purity and weightlessness. Six grand columns anchor the space, each hand-carved from traditional han bail yu white marble, the same as used in the emperor’s palaces in the Forbidden City.

As part of a $123 million basement-to-roof renovation to be completed this month, the hotel did away with clunky, old school check-ins. Instead, not unlike Apple stores, guests are welcomed by staff armed with iPads, all of which can provide check-in and check-out, concierge services, book spa appointments, and so forth. The tech trend continues into the rooms — down from 525 to only 230 post-renovation, making these among the largest and most comfortable in all of China — where an iPad in every individual room allows climate and lighting control as well as provides paperless hotel and city information at the swipe of a fingertip. You can even use the tablets to book an entire health and wellness day during your stay. The on-site gym and pool  are among the best you will find in any hotel. The spa offers a dazzling menu of treatments featuring traditional Chinese techniques and materials, like a Yin-Yang massage that starts with a skin brush and exfoliation, then moves into a cool stone massage and calming linen
wrap of chysanthemum, black lychee and green tea essential oils. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed by all the workout class options, spa services and so forth, you can ask for some advice from your very own physiotherapist — the hotel keeps one on staff.",,
